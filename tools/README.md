# `/tools`

To use the script, ROM file must be placed in the root as `rmz3/baserom.gba`.

Scripts require Deno runtime installation.

```sh
rmz3/tools
      ├── common        # Common subroutine for /dev, /dumper, /misc
      ├── dev           # This directory contains the build scripts used when building rmz3.gba.
      ├── dumper        # This directory contains data dumpers for decompilation work.
      └── misc          # Misc scripts useful for Decomp
```
